# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
### The use of logistic regression in predicting survival on the Titanic offers a poignant insight into the factors influencing the tragic outcome of the disaster. By analyzing historical passenger data, logistic regression allows us to model the relationship between survival and various passenger characteristics such as age, gender, and ticket class. Through this method, we can estimate the likelihood of survival for individual passengers based on their profile. This analysis not only sheds light on the determinants of survival during the Titanic's fateful voyage but also holds broader implications for understanding risk assessment and disaster preparedness. Ultimately, by applying logistic regression to this historical event, we honor the memory of those who perished and gain valuable insights into the dynamics of survival amidst tragedy.
